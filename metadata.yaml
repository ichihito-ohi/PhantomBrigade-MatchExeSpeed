  [y=1.2][b]Description[/b][/y]

  This mod matches the time speed in the execution phase with the "slow" speed in the replay phase. Also, it suppresses the easing of the time speed curve.

  [y=1.2][b]Known Issues[/b][/y]

  - The time speed of "Full" is shown as "1.00x" on the control bar UI though the actual speed is 0.20x.
  - This mod linearly slows down the timescale of the execution phase. The execution cannot play at the default "full" speed. It may feel too slow to do it every time.
