# Match Execution Speed

This mod matches the time speed in the execution phase with the "slow" speed in the replay phase. Also, it suppresses the easing of the time speed curve.


## Recommendation

- [Silent Start (by EchKode)](https://github.com/echkode/PhantomBrigadeMod_SilentStart)


## Known Issues

- The time speed of "Full" is shown as "1.00x" on the control bar UI though the actual speed is 0.20x.
- This mod linearly slows down the timescale of the execution phase. The execution cannot play at the default "full" speed. It may feel too slow to do it every time.
